# On Site Services

Working remotely has its benefits. It is wonderful to work wherever and
whenever we can. Unfortunately it does not match the knowledge
transfer in face to face interactions. People can communicate more
effectively, ask questions, and build lasting rapport. I've had great
success working with clients in person. Sometimes you just can't beat
working in the same room with another person. Here are some things
that simply work better in person:

* Migrate existing developers to the Ruby ecosystem
* Bring experienced Ruby developers up to speed in modern web
  application development
* Code review
* A fresh perspective on existing development processes and codebases
* Testing practices workshops
* Performance reviews
* Staff augmentation
* Infrastructure review

I will come to your office and work one on one or with your team for
at least one entire work day. During the time I'm on site we will work
together to accomplish business goals, be it raise developer knowledge
or pair on new features, I'm confident we will reach our goal.

You agree to cover the flight and accommodations. I agree to bring my
breadth knowledge to bear on your business. I'm living in Europe.
You're company is located anywhere. On site services start at
**$2000**. [Email me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=On+Site+Services)
and let's figure out a way to improve your business.
