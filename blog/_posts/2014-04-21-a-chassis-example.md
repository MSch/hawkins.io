title: "A Chassis Example"

I've been getting more and more questions about
[Chassis](https://github.com/ahawkins/chassis). It's clear that it's
time for a written example. I give you a [chassis
example](https://github.com/ahawkins/chassis-example).

The app does not use all the modules in chassis, but it does give you
a window in my development style these days. The code base does use:

* The repository pattern
* Port & Adatpers w/ `Chassis.strategy`
* Form objects w/ `Chassis.form`
* Multiple tests modes
* Use cases
* Sinatra

I hope this clarifies some things.
