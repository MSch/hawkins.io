title: After Ruby Sauna

I just got back from the [ruby sauna](http://rubysauna.org). It was an
awesome local event in Oulu, Finland. The event was geared at getting
more people in the area interested in Ruby. The area used to be
heavily Nokia biased and contains plenty of talented developers.
[Florian Blank](http://twitter.com/polarblau) invited me speak.
I gave a soft talk on the [ruby ecosystem](https://speakerdeck.com/ahawkins/ruby-a-wonderfully-diverse-ecosystem).
It was the most fun I had a ruby event in a long time. It was
wonderful to give a soft talk on the ruby community and the people.

[Ville Kolehmainen](http://twitter.com/villek) wrote a nice tweet:

> The "co" in ecosystem might as well stand for community. Refreshing

> \#rubysauna

That tweet lifted my spirits and put a smile on my face. Apparently it
put a smile on his too. Ville tweeted later:

> @AnnikaJuvani from #railsgirlsoulu is up. Listening to her,
> @adman65, @avdi and @rubysauna peeps somehow makes me really happy.
> Thanks!

The last part was even better. I spent three hours in a wonderful
finnish sauna chatting it up people I'd met. We even got to glimpse
the northern lights which apparently is quite rare in Oulu.

There was something special about the event. It was so cool to connect
with a small local group of people. Florian said he felt the same. The
reception was positive. I hope that Florian and
[Tuomas](http://twitter.com/tuomasj) can take their show on the road
to more parts of Finland. I think it would be a great way to get more
people interested in our community. The format would work well in
other countries as well. So if you happen to see Florian or Tuomas in
Finland, please say "Kiitos" because the event was awesome. If you're
ever by a ruby sauna, you should certainly go.
