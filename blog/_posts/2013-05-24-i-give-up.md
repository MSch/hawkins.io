This is the story of day in the life of trying to use Ember-Data for
anything other demo apps. There is a lot of stuff out there about
Ember Data. This post is a warning for those considering using it.

## The Tale

Today my coworker [Paul Cowan (@dagda1)](https://twitter.com/dagda1) were working
on our Ember project. We decided to stay with `DS.FixtureAdapter` for
as long as possible. We wanted to do this because it made developing
the actual application easier and we didn't need to worry about API
stuff until we had gotten the client side abstractions right. Paul
described it as "living in a dream world." I believe he also used the
words "in Disneyland." I don't know if you've ever been to Disneyland,
but that place is fucked up. I was there on 4th of July years ago on a
vacation. There was almost a riot in front of Cinderella's castle.
Someone pushing a disabled person around in a wheel chair tried to run
is over. It was insanity. It was a nightmare. Just like today.

Our attack plan was simple. We will simply change the store's adapter
to a `DS.RESTAdapter` and just customize shit until we get it right.
We are using `ActiveModel::Serializers` so it should (*wink wink*) be
plug and play. Then I remembered this:

> It's more like plug and pray!

My friend Andrei said that. It was very so prefect. We did the boiler
plat code and were ready to turn the damn thing on. I don't know if
you've ever rebuilt a car before. It felt like that moment after you
do an engine swap, everything is ready, and you sit there and think:
"well, here we go." You sit down in the drivers seat and insert the
key into the ignition. You mentally cross of everything that could go
wrong. Did I put the piston rings in correctly? Are is my valve timing
right? There are so many ways you can completely explode your car, so
of course your nervous. I had been working on a semi-functional API
for a few days. We were at this point. I was 100% certain I'd see
1487324 errors in Chrome console. I thought I was mentally prepared
for the road ahead.

2 days of some of the hardest debugging and code spelunking I've ever
done followed--and was to simply retreive one user from the API.
Ludacris stuff.

We countered a lot of problems. The immediate problem was the typical
ember blank screen: white screen, blank console. Both of which are
unhelpful. The only thing you can do is put a `debugger` inside
ember-data and work backwards. This is what we did.

There were no exceptions for us to debug so we started from the
beginning. We figured that the missing exceptions where a weird thing,
but nothing to pay serious attention to. Instead we stepped through
ED's code one method at a time to see where it was going wrong. All
the problems were in record deserialization and materialization. This
is the process for taking a response from the data, instantiating
objects, connecting associations, and finally construction `DS.Model`
objects. Our goal was simple: retreive the logged in user and their
settings (since this is what we need to bootstrap the app). We
encountered 3 main problems (all of which were swallowed by ED).

1. ED failed to report that an associated class did not exist. Record
   deserialization was failing silently because we had a class
   misspelled.
2. ED failed to report exceptions form a deserialize call. This was
   simply mispelling `JSON.parse` in `deserialize`.
3. ED feiled to report invalid JSON back from the server. One of our
   keys was named incorrectly. ED swallowed this and simply reported
   no data at all. Not just no data for that attribute not an empty
   record.

We found all of these problem by painstackingly stepping through ED's
internals. I took us about a day to simply load in one (incomplete)
record from the server. There was one thing that was still very
unsettling: we still did not know why the exceptions were not being
raised. We figured that was some weird edge case thing with async
programming + the ember run loop. Unfortunately that was not the case.

One we had the current user it was time to load their data. This is
when things when from bad to mind bendingly frustrating. We did some
`DS.Model.all()` calls to load collections of records. These of
failed. Failed as in, no data returned, no errors raised, and the
standard empty screen. At this point we realized that there was no
edgecase causing use to lose exceptions. We knew that exceptions were
being swallowed because the server was sending different JSON than the
client expected. There was no possible way anything could be working.
It had to be broken. It was no longer feasible to spent a day stepping
through ED's internals to track down everything that was being
swallowed. We had to actually figure out what swallowing the
exceptions.

This is something I we almost refused to accept was actually
happening. It seemd completely infeasible that the authors would allow
this to happen. This could only happen for two real reasons: 1) No one
is actually using this code for anything, 2) a simple mistake. I was
hoping for the former. We didn't expect the authors (who we know) to
make such a glaring mistake. Paul and I thought we were going insane
through the entire debugging process. We were left with a very rude
awakening.

Internally Ember-Data uses a promise to send a request to the server
and when it's returned, then process the data. Here is the simple 4
line of code that ruined our day.

```javascript
return this.ajax(this.buildURL(root), "GET",{
  data: this.sinceQuery(since)
}).then(function(json) {
  Ember.run(adapter,'didFindAll', store, type, json);
});
```

Basically everything related to parsing the JSON is wrapped in a
promise callback. Unfortunately, all errors inside a promise chain
must be handled explicitly. The simple honest fact that this code is
missing an error handler. So at the time of this writing: **all errors
related to record loading are swallowed.** So all errors related to
the library's core use case are silently ignored. This is hillariously
bad. This is a simple programming mistake. It can be fixed with:

```javascript
return this.ajax(this.buildURL(root), "GET",{
  data: this.sinceQuery(since)
}).then(function(json) {
  Ember.run(adapter,'didFindAll', store, type, json);
}).then(null, function(error) {
  setTimeout() { throw(error); }
});
```

And voilla! Now the end users can see useful exceptions. This would
have fixed all our problems. We spent all of our time chasing down the
missing exceptions. If they were simply reported from the beginning,
this post would not be written.

It was very frustrating to spend two days debugging ED internals to
simply load very basic data. Although this doesn't frustrate me the
most. I have prexisting knowledge of ED because I've contributed to
the project. There are probably few people in the world who would put
up with the level of debugging we did--let alone with enough knowledge
of the internals to get to the root cause. I also find this failure
hillariously bad. Swallowing exceptions by default is just plain
wrong. The Promises/A spec states that all errors must handles in the
error callback. I think this very unfortunate that the default
behavior is to ignore exceptions. When this combined with the most
problematic area in programming (parsing data or user input) you're in
a for a world of hurt.

The simple fact of the matter is that ember-data is not for normal
people. The github page states that it is not production ready and you
should be cautious. However I think the warning is not strong enough.
Ember-data isn't RC level. It's not beta. It's not alpha. It's before
that. It's so primitive and fluid that you can't even give it a
version. Hell, ember-data is barely suited for **development**
purposes. Think about that for a moment. This is not a library for
normal people.

I recommended people look at ED before this experience. My
recommendation was just look at it and play with it. Don't rely on it.
It's not ready. Now my position has changed. Don't even look at this
code. Don't use it if you care about your time or sanity. It's simply
to primal right now. You should only use ED if you meet these
criteria:

* You are comfortable building form source (How many of you would only
  install something if it's in homebrew)
* You are willing to actually spend time understanding ED's internals
  to the point where it's like your own code.
* You are willing to give constructive feedback and fix bugs you find
* You understand the previous 3 points and accept that will be much
  harder and painful than you expect.

I care about ember-data greatly. It's a very important ambitious
project that's going to change the way we write web applications.
Ember + Ember-Data has such a huge value proposition that I'll put up
with such matters. But you proably not like me. You probaly just want
to build shit. You got used to using mature tools like Rails.
Unfortunately client side Javascript is still in it's infancy. There
are few mature tools (mainly Backbone and Sproutcore). The moral of
the story here is: if you use ember-data right now you will get burned
and probably hard. However that are people out there getting burned
who care more about these problems then you do. We're looking out for
you. 

Since I'm looking out for you i've submitted a [PR](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/995)
to fix this issue. I would not suprised if the same issue could happen
inside Ember (which also uses promises internally). In the mean time
stay away from Ember Data. I thought it was ready for people
to look at it. It's not. You've been warned. We'll let you know when
you should check it out.
