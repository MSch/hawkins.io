        <h3 id='abstract'>Abstract</h3>

<p>Take an abstract notion of accounting and billing and build a pure ruby implementation. After the abstractions are complete, then use the simple abstractions to build a system capable of charing credit cards, managing usage based billing, subscriptions and customers. The code is developed using TDD (with Rspec) and can be used in any piece of Ruby code or be included in a larger service layer.</p>

<h3 id='notes'>Notes</h3>

<p>This talk focus on solving a real world problem in our product. We needed a component that could actually charge people, but it needed to be free-form enough that it could adapt to store subscriptions, one time of chargers, and support usage based billing. Credit card processing is done with Stripe, but could easily be swapped out with another gateway.</p>
