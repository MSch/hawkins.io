I recently purchased Nathan Barry's
[Authority](http://nathanbarry.com/authority/). The book motivated me
to write my own book. I've done a lot of work on making Rails
applications faster and more performant. My plog posts on [advanced
caching](/2012/07/advanced_caching_revised/) are the most read and
linked to guides on the topic. I wrote the initial post in 2010. It
was very well received. The post was rewritten and updated in 2012.
This version was jampacked with more relavant information. If you
google for "advanced caching rails, the posts are the top hits.
They've been linked in countless StackOverflow questions and
presentations. It's always interesting to see where the referrers come
from.

I've also started [performance consultations](/performance-consultations)
over the past year. I realized there is not a lot of good information
on this topic.  Developers really crave this stuff. Application speed
and responsiveness play a lot into end user experience. The fact is
usres perfer fast applications over slow ones. I know a lot about this
area so it only made sense to bundle up all my knowledge into a book!

The book is not just about caching. It's about total performance
strategies for your application. The book will cover all aspects from
bottleneck detection, instrumentation, monitoring, profiling, caching,
and many other issues. The book itself uses Rails 4. Things relavant
to Rails 3.2 will be mentioned and discussed as well.

However, this is more than just a book! The complete package includes
tutorials, screencasts, interviews, and other resources. I'm
personally the most execited for the interviews because they should be
the most interesting. I've lined up well known and experienced
community members, such as **David Heinemeier Hansson** and developers from
top consultancies from around the world, to tell you how they get it
done day to day. All in all I'm planning on 15-20 interviews.

The book is launching in August/September. Head over to
