# Performance Consultations

Do you have a killer web app but need to squeeze out all the performance?
Not sure what to try next?

I can solve your performance problems.

I've worked on traditional Rails applications and modern client side
apps using Ember.js. I've helped people all across the spectrum make
their apps faster and pass on knowledge. I've never had an
unsatisified customer.

If you are unsatisfied the result, I will give you 100% of your money back.

## "The brainstorm" Package

We put our heads together for an hour:

* I will review the code with you within the call
* Show you where the problem areas
* Provide a strategy to make your app faster

This service is **$300**. [Email me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Performance+Consultation) if this
describes you.

## The "I'll Make Your Problems Go Away" Package

* Testing your application for common problems
* Implement simple fixes where applicable
* Plan a comprehensive solution for you (or another contractor) to
  implement.
* Review findings and answer your questions in a call

This service is **$1000**. [Email me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Performance+Consultation) if this
describes you.

## Coaching

I can also implement any strategies described in our consultations or
on my blog. Fast applications matter. They play huge roll in user
experience. Users love fast application. I can work 1 one 1 or with a
team implementing a custom performance strategy for your application.
This means you and I will work together so I can fully understand your
application and what is important. This service **starts at $3000**. [Email
me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Performance+Consultation) and let's
talk if this describes you.

The general consultations happen over Google Hangouts or Skype. Google
Hangouts are better because they can be recorded and shared with your
coworkers. Consultations are usually scheduled for one or two days
after initial contact.

If you are interested please [email
me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Performance+Consultation). I look
forward to working with you.
